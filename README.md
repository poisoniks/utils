## Automated Minecraft & Crafty Controller Installer
This bash script provides a streamlined, "one-command" setup for hosting modded Minecraft servers on Ubuntu (20.04+).
It automates the installation of the Crafty Controller web interface, multi-version Java environments (8, 17, and 21), and required system dependencies.
Beyond installation, the script configures a basic UFW firewall with optional IP-whitelisting for the web panel, and automatically fetching and prepping your chosen modpack.
Although, some manual steps are still required in Crafty UI admin panel. But the script provides post-installation instructions to help you link the modpack files within the Crafty UI.
